To avoid this issue:

1. **Explicit Key Management:** If sequential numerical indexing is important, maintain contiguous keys. Instead of relying on implicit key assignment, assign keys explicitly:

```php
$myArray = [];
for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
  $myArray[$i] = 'value' . $i;
}
```

2. **Alternative Data Structures:** If numerical order isn't crucial, consider using other structures better suited to data organization such as associative arrays or objects. 

```php
$myObject = new \stdClass();
$myObject->one = 'value1';
$myObject->two = 'value2';
$myObject->three = 'value3';
```

3. **Array Sorting (When Order Matters):** If you need to process the array based on numerical order, sort the array after populating it using `ksort()`. This will sort the array by keys.

```php
ksort($myArray);
```

Choose the approach that best suits your specific needs and coding style. The key takeaway is to be mindful of PHP's flexible array key handling and its implications when relying on specific key ordering or sequencing.
